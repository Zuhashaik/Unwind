# Unwind

## An Conversational AI bot powered by state-of-the-art transformers to help people with mental issues.


Unwind is an app that was developed by four undergrads on their sophomore for their porject for software development.

This app aims to help people with mental illness by chatting with them like a theraphist and can provide them a solid privacy within the conversation.

As the app is in development stage an api call is being used to communicate and privacy might not be at its best but in the later stages it will be ensured
